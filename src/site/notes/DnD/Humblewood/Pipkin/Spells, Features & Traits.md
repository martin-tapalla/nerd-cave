Spell Descriptors

**Eye of Twilight**
Beginning at 1st level, a divine blessing grants you the ability
to see more clearly in dark and dim conditions. You can see
in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
in magical or nonmagical darkness as if it were only dim light.
You can’t discern color in the darkness, only shades of gray.
When you reach 6th level, you can see in dim light within
120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in magical or
nonmagical darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern
color in the darkness, only shades of gray.
At 8th level, you can see normally in darkness, both magical
and nonmagical within 120 feet.
Finally, at 17th level, your eyes are able to see the truth
hiding within darkness. You gain the ability to call upon the
powers of your deity to grant yourself truesight within 120 feet
of you for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier
(a minimum of 1 minute). Your truesight only functions
while in conditions of magical or nonmagical darkness. Once
you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you
have completed a long rest.

**Ward of Shadows**
At 1st level, you can create a ward of divine shadows to
conceal yourself from an attacking enemy. When attacked by
a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can use your
reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, as shadows
envelop your form. An attacker that can’t be blinded is
immune to this feature.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to
your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Channel Divinity: Invocation of Night**
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
harness the powers of night, clouding the vision of your foes in
a shroud of darkness. As an action, you present your holy symbol causing any source of mundane or magical light within 30 feet of you to
be extinguished. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30
feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
who fails the saving throw is blinded for a number of rounds
equal to your cleric level. A creature blinded in this way gets a
new saving throw at the end of each of its turns to remove the
effect. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

**Improved Ward**
At 6th level, you can use your Ward of Shadows feature
whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a
creature besides yourself.

**Veil of Dreams**
When you reach 8th level, you gain mastery over magical
sleep. When you cast the sleep spell, add your cleric level to the
dice you roll to determine how many hit points of creatures
the spell can affect.
You may choose the order in which creatures within the
spell’s area are affected. If the first target chosen has too many
hit points to be affected, the spell will instead target the next
creature you have chosen that the spell could affect before
affecting other targets.
Additionally, any creature you put to sleep cannot be
woken until the start of your next turn. Otherwise, the sleep
spell acts as normal.

**Creature of the Night**
Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate a
supernatural aura of deep night. It lasts for 1 minute, or until
you dismiss it using another action. You emit heavily obscuring
darkness in a 30-foot radius and lightly obscuring shadows
50 feet beyond that. The darkness and shadows overlap and
smother existing sources of light. Only light produced by a 9th
level spell or similarly powerful effect can negate the darkness
and shadows.
Enemies within the shadows constantly feel the presence
of hungry predators watching them, and become frightened
as long as they remain inside the affected area. Enemies in the
darkness are both blinded and frightened for as long as they
remain within its area.
