| Personality Traits | - **Cheerful Optimist:** Pipkin always sees the best in every situation and every creature, even when things look dire. His default expression is a bright smile.<br>- **Endearingly Ditzy:** He often gets things slightly wrong, misinterprets situations, or says things that are a little out of place, but always with the best intentions.<br>- **Unflappable:** Nothing seems to truly embarrass or upset Pipkin. He rolls with the punches and quickly bounces back from any awkwardness.<br>- **Curious and Inquisitive:** He loves learning about everything and everyone, often asking a barrage of (sometimes naive) questions.<br>- **Warm and Affectionate:** Pipkin is quick to offer a kind word, a gentle touch (though sometimes his quills get in the way!), or a comforting presence.<br>- **Talkative:** He enjoys chatting with anyone and anything, from fellow adventurers to woodland critters to inanimate objects that look interesting.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Ideals             | - **Kindness:** Treating others with compassion and understanding is paramount to Pipkin. He believes everyone deserves a chance.<br>- **Helpfulness:** He feels a strong urge to assist those in need, no matter how big or small the problem.<br>- **Acceptance:** Pipkin believes in embracing differences and finding common ground with all beings. His own unique upbringing has instilled this deeply.<br>- **The Comfort of Night:** He sees the night as a time for rest, healing, and quiet contemplation, and believes in offering solace to those who find themselves in darkness, both literally and figuratively (aligned with Tyton).<br>- **Joy:** Pipkin believes in finding and spreading happiness whenever possible. Life is an adventure to be enjoyed!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Bonds              | - **His Adoptive Family:** Pipkin holds Elara and Barnaby Meadowlight in the highest regard and feels a deep love and loyalty towards them and his Cervan siblings. He often speaks of their kindness and support.<br>- **The Creatures of the Forest:** He feels a strong kinship with the animals of the Whisperwood and surrounding areas, believing they have their own wisdom and deserve respect. He might have a few particular animal friends he's especially fond of.<br>- **The Teachings of Tyton:** He is devoted to his faith and feels a strong connection to the Nightfather, interpreting his tenets through his own optimistic lens. He might carry a small, personally significant holy symbol.<br>- **A Specific Place in the Farmlands:** Perhaps a favorite meadow, a cozy burrow he used to frequent, or the pumpkin patch where he was found holds a special place in his heart. He might feel a strong desire to protect it.<br>- **A Mentor Figure (perhaps another cleric or a wise animal):** Someone who helped him understand his connection to Tyton or navigate the world as a small hedgehog might hold a special place in his heart. |
| Flaws              | - **Oblivious to Social Cues:** Pipkin often misses subtle hints, personal boundaries, or the underlying seriousness of a situation.<br>- **Forgets His Size:** This leads to comical and sometimes precarious situations, like trying to fit into small spaces or underestimating his own limitations.<br>- **Naive Trust:** His inherent optimism can sometimes make him too trusting of others, potentially leading him into trouble.<br>- **Distractible:** Pipkin's curiosity can easily lead him astray, causing him to lose focus on important tasks. A shiny object or an interesting sound can catch his attention.<br>- **Overly Enthusiastic:** His eagerness to help can sometimes lead to him getting in the way or offering assistance that isn't actually needed or helpful.<br>- **Occasional Misinterpretations of Faith:** His cheerful perspective on Tyton might sometimes clash with more traditional or somber interpretations of the Nightfather's will.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Background:** Raised in the serene farmlands bordering the Whisperwood, Pipkin's early life was anything but typical. He was found as a tiny babe, no bigger than a pinecone, nestled amongst a patch of particularly plump pumpkins by Elara Meadowlight, a kind-hearted **Cervan** (deer-folk) farmer. Elara and her husband, Barnaby Meadowlight, a jovial **Jerboa** (desert mouse-folk) with a perpetually twitching nose and an uncanny ability to trip over thin air, took the little hedgehog in without a second thought.<br><br>Pipkin always knew he was different from his siblings (a pair of graceful Cervan twins). While they had long legs and elegant gaits, Pipkin waddled with surprising speed and possessed an impressive array of quills that occasionally startled the livestock. His adoptive parents, however, showered him with unwavering love and never made him feel like an outsider. In fact, Barnaby, his adoptive father, possessed a unique brand of absentmindedness and a penchant for silly jokes that Pipkin seemed to have inherited, often leading to comical misunderstandings and shared fits of giggles. Barnaby, in his own way, was also endearingly oblivious to social cues and often forgot the size difference between himself and others, a trait Pipkin mirrored.<br><br>From a young age, Pipkin felt a deep connection to the quiet mystery of the night. While his siblings enjoyed the bright sunshine, Pipkin found solace and wonder in the moonlit groves and the hushed whispers of nocturnal creatures. He would often sneak out after dusk, his little quills rustling through the undergrowth, to listen to the owls' hoots and the crickets' chirps. It was during one of these nocturnal wanderings that he experienced a profound connection to Tyton, the Nightfather. Not through booming pronouncements or celestial visions, but through a feeling of gentle understanding and the quiet power that permeated the twilight hours. He felt a calling to protect the vulnerable, to offer comfort in the darkness, and to find the hidden beauty in the shadows.<br><br>His faith in Tyton is as bright as the moon he reveres, though his understanding of the Nightfather's tenets is often filtered through his own cheerful and somewhat ditzy perspective. He sees Tyton's domain not as one of fear or secrecy, but as a comforting blanket of darkness that allows for rest, healing, and the subtle magic of the night.<br><br>Pipkin's heart overflows with a desire to help everyone he meets, from the smallest field mouse to the tallest stag. He approaches every interaction with an open and friendly demeanor, often striking up conversations with anyone and anything – be it a grumpy badger or a particularly interesting-looking mushroom. His tendency to forget his size often leads to humorous situations, like trying to squeeze through spaces clearly too small for him or offering a "helping hand" that turns out to be a surprisingly prickly nudge.<br><br>Despite his occasional ditziness and social blunders, Pipkin possesses a genuine kindness and unwavering optimism that endears him to most. He is utterly unburdened by embarrassment, shrugging off awkward moments with a cheerful grin and moving on to the next friendly face. His genuine love for the creatures of the forest is evident in his gentle interactions and his unwavering belief in the good in everyone. He often shares stories with the local wildlife, convinced they understand every word, and is always eager to lend a helping paw, even if his assistance is more enthusiastic than effective.<br> |     |
| **Why is he adventuring?** Perhaps Pipkin felt a calling from Tyton to venture out and spread comfort and aid throughout Humblewood. Maybe a specific event in his community sparked his desire to help on a larger scale. Or perhaps, in true Pipkin fashion, he simply wandered off one day, following a particularly interesting butterfly, and decided that adventuring looked like a wonderful way to meet new friends and help even more people (and creatures!).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |     |

# Night Domain
The night is mysterious, and conceals many unseen dangers. However, the cover of darkness also brings protection from predators and shadows within which one can conceal themselves. The gods of night are varied, encompassing those who would use the cover of darkness to conceal others from threats, to those who would use the shadows for wrong doings.
The motives of night gods are often shrouded in mystery. Many teach their followers that it is only by peering through the darkness and looking beyond what is hidden that one can attain truth. Clerics of night do their best to keep themselves and their companions safe while journeying through the darkness.
