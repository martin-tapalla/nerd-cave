Greetings! My name is Martin, but some call me "Marty"

Welcome to the Nerd Cave - a digital garden that is all things me from [photography](https://www.instagram.com/behind.walters.lens) to [Dungeons and Dragons Campaigns](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) (which is currently 1 at the moment). Currently a nursing student who loves to dive into my hobbies when I can.
